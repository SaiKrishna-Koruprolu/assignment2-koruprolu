###### Discus throw_Country India
The ***discus throw***, also known as disc throw, **is a track and field event** in which an athlete throws a heavy disc—called a discus—in an attempt to mark a farther distance than their competitors.
I like the sport because it involves **core strength of human body to throw the disc**.
